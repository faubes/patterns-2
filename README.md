After Snowed In Hack Day:

Wrote tests and implementations for Cell, Grid, Design and Guess

Started wiring UI to use new game logic; still need to finish Create and Guess scenes.

Also need to fix persistent storage of designs.

There's a TestRunner.tscn ready with a few example tests.

There's bits and pieces of a Create and Guess scenes/scripts here, but I intend to basically scrap everything and re-start with a TDD approach.
