# patterns-2
Implentation of Sid Sackson's pen and paper pattern guessing game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_II).

Godot v. 3.2.1 with GUT plugin for Unit Testing. There's a TestRunner.tscn ready with a few example tests.

There's bits and pieces of a Create and Guess scenes/scripts here, but I intend to basically scrap everything and re-start with a TDD approach.
